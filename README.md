Mediasite Downloader 
=====================

This repo contains my work on creating a downloader for mediasite videos, since my usual downloader plugin doesn't 
work and the player sucks.

Using the tapermonkey script
------------------------------

1. Open `downloader.js` 
2. click the "raw" button 
3. copy paste into new tapermonkey script 
4. go to mediasite video 
5. click download 
6. wait

Note: If it doesn't offer you a download dialog, go to:

1. tapermonkey settings 
2. config mode -> advanced 
3. Downloads -> download mode -> browser api
